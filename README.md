![alt text](icon.ico "Title")
## Getting Started
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- Build the project with `Visual Studio using` C# and .NET 8.0.
- When starting the application for the first time, it automatically downloads the used `llama3.2` language model.
- When the download is completed you are ready to use it offline.
- Don't close the application, just minimize it.
- Simple spellchecking can be triggered in any other application (e.g., Notepad) by selecting the text and pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+Q`.
- To also improve the wording of the selected text you can press `CTRL+SHIFT+W`.
- The used model, hotkeys and system prompts can be changed in the `AssistApp.dll.config` file.
